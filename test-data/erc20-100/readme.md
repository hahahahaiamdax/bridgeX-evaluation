## Number of participating accounts
100

## Rules
1. For each transaction, pick one account from the pool of 100 pre-created users as the sender.

## Results
1. The number of slots updated per synchronization never exceeds 100.
2. Because the slot count stays under 100, the state-sync transactions succeed.
